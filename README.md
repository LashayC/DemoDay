## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js

I built this also after considering the most convenient way to display info to clients. Once the form was built I got to work making sure the routes.js worked properly. From there I styled the rendering of the EJS.

## Lessons Learned:

After building this app I wanted to add more functionality with the data and got to use the datajs module as opposed to the deprecated momentjs. Using this I was able to add a current day medication section.
